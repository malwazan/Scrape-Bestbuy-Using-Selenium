# Scrape-Bestbuy-Using-Selenium-And-BeautifulSoup

In this project I used Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape Bestbuy laptops reviews. It is hard to scrape bestbuy using Scrapy, that is why I used Selenium to Scrape the laptops reviews. 
Dependencies Required:
- pip install Selenium
- pip install beautifulsoup4
- pip install pandas
- pip install csv
- You also eed to download chromedriver from "https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads". Check the version of google chrome installed on youy OS and then download the same version of chromedriver from this website, otherwise chromedriver will not work properly.
- Once Downloaded, replace the line 119 in code with the PATH of chromedriver in your PC.

Now you are ready to run the script and download top 20 reviews for all the laptops on bestbuy.com
